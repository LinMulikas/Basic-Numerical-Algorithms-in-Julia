# Julia

# 1. Foundamentary

## 1.1 function

```Julia
function funcName(param1, param2, ...)

    [Return value]
end
```

The last line of a function will be returned as the return value. And one can also use the keyword 'return'.

## 1.2 struct

Julia use the keyword [[struct]] as the definition of a structure, which means a combination of some existing data.

The [[struct]] can has a [[inner constructor]], but actually, [[Julia]] encourage the user use [[function]] as the [[outer constructor]].



# 2. Type System





[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[inner constructor]: <inner constructor> "inner constructor"
[function]: function "function"
[outer constructor]: <outer constructor> "outer constructor"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
